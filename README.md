# Anki-Night-Mode

This plugin adds the function of night mode, similar that one implemented in AnkiDroid.

It adds a "view" menu entity (if it doesn't exist) with options like:
- switching night mode
- inverting colors of images or latex formulas
- modifying some of the colors

It provides shortcut ctrl+n to quickly switch mode and color picker to adjust some of color parameters.

After enabling night mode, addon changes colors of menubar, toolbar, bottombars and content windows.

Feel free to send bug reports and feature requests!
